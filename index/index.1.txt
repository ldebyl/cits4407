index(1)                         index man page                         index(1)



NAME
       index - generates a line number index of tagged terms from a text
       document.

SYNOPSIS
       index [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       Generates an index of lines numbers containing tagged terms. A tag
       consists of a term or phrase enclosed in angle brackets (<>). A term or
       phrase may contain characters, spaces, numbers and punctuation (with the
       exception of a closing bracket). Multiple tags may appear in a single
       line. Where the same tag appears multiple times in a single line, the
       line is only include once in the generated index.

       The index is not case sensitive - all tags will be converted to
       lowercase.

       The index is not sorted by default. If sorting is desired, a utility such
       as sort can be used.

OPTIONS
       filename
              File to generate the index from. If not specified, the index is
              generated from stdin.

RETURNS
       0      Returns 0 if no errors occured.

EXAMPLES
       An example execution on a tagged version of the begging lines of the mawk
       man page:

              <mawk>  is  an  <interpreter>  for the <AWK> Programming Language.
              The <AWK> language is useful for manipulation of data files, text
              retrieval and processing, and for prototyping and experimenting
              with algorithms.  <mawk> is a new awk meaning it implements the
              <AWK> language as defined in <Aho>, <Kernighan> and <Weinberger>,
              The <AWK> Program‚Äê ming Language, Addison-Wesley Publishing, 1988
              (hereafter referred to as the <AWK> book.)   <mawk>  conforms  to
              the  <POSIX> 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the <AWK> language
              which contains a few features not described in the <AWK> book, and
              <mawk> provides a small number of extensions.

              An <AWK> <program> is a sequence of pattern {action} pairs and
              function definitions.  Short <program>s are entered on  the
              command line usually enclosed in ' ' to avoid shell
              interpretation.  Longer <program>s can be read in from a file with
              the -f option.  Data  input is read from the list of files on  the
              command  line  or  from

       Invoking the indexing utility:
       $ ./index test.txt
       posix 13
       program 5,6,16,17
       aho 11
       awk 9,11,11,12,13,14,16
       kernighan 11
       interpreter 9
       weinberger 11
       mawk 2,5,6,9,10,12,14
