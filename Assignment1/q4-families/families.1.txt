NAME
       families - generates a list of families where all members of a family
       aboard the Titanic survived.

SYNOPSIS
       families [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       The script consumes the Titanic data set available at
       https://www.kaggle.com/paytontaylor/titanic-dataset-observations which
       details the list of passengers aboard the Titanic, and whether they
       survived. From this list, the script generates a list of families where
       all family members survived.

       For the purpose of this excercise, a family is defined as two or more
       people having the same surname. The surname is derived from the forth
       field and consists of all characters up until the first comma.

       The output consists of the sorted, unique names of familes that meet the
       criteria.

OPTIONS
       [filename]
              The filname to read the dataset from. If not provided, the dataset
              is read from titanicdata.csv

BUGS
       The script assumes that the input CSV file is specifically formatted as
       retrieved from the URL above. Behaviour of the program is undefined in
       other cases and will not robustly handle reformatting by programs such as
       Excel.

       The program does not perform any validation of the input file format, nor
       does it check that the input file exists. awk will raise an error if the
       input file does not exist, or other parsing errors occured.
