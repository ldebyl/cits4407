NAME
       lotto - generates unique random numbers within a given range, as per a
       typical Australian Lotto draw.

SYNOPSIS
       lotto [-n] [-r]

DESCRIPTION
       Generates n unique random numbers, each between 1 and r. The generated
       numbers are ordered from lowest to highest. By default, 6 random numbers
       are drawn, from 45 possible numbers.

OPTIONS
       -n     The number of balls to draw.

       -r     The number of balls to choose from.

RETURNS
       0      Returns 0 if no errors occured.

SEE ALSO
       shuf(1)

BUGS
       The script generates unique random numbers by repeatedly generating a
       random number until the first unseen random number is generated. The
       execution time of the script is therefore non-deterministic. In some
       cases, the script may take longer than average to execute. A future
       improvement would be to include a data structure that included the
       remaining available numbers, and randomly select and remove these
       elements. Alternatively, using an algorithm such as the Knuth-Fisher-
       Yates shuffling algorithm and taking the top-n elements would be a
       reasonable alterntive.

       The number of balls to choose from cannot exceed 32,768.
